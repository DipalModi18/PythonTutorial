# Packages are namespaces which contain multiple packages and modules themselves. They are simply directories, but with a twist.
#
# Each package in Python is a directory which MUST contain a special file called __init__.py. This file can be empty, and it indicates that the directory it contains is a Python package, so it can be imported the same way a module can be imported.
