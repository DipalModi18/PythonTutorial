# it is possible to set up the HTTP server so that whenever a file in a certain directory is requested
#               that file is not sent back; instead it is executed as a program,
#               and whatever that program outputs is sent back for your browser to display.
#               This function is called the Common Gateway Interface or CGI and the programs are called CGI scripts.
# These CGI programs can be a Python Script, PERL Script,
#               Shell Script, C or C++ program, etc.
